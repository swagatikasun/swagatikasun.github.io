Iâ€™m a 4th-year _Computer Science_ Ph.D. Scholar at **PLANR Lab, IIT Patna**, working under the guidance of Dr. Raju Halder. My research focuses on using blockchain technology to build secure and robust applications while leveraging the potential of language tools and associated technologies. Additionally, I enjoy investigating and resolving problems pertaining to language tools and cryptography. Besides, my current research interests include the following:

-   Exploring how blockchain technology might help make existing systems more resilient, secure, and immutable.
-   Developing interoperable and interconnected blockchain-based applications.
-   Improving privacy and security aspects of federated systems, introducing modular access control paradigms.
-   Verification of Smart contracts using formal methods.

Beyond my research, I enjoy reading novels, writing poems, and turning potential waste items into beautiful artworks.

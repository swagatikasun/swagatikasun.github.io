I’m currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the LRC Lab, University of Montreal, where I work alongside Prof. Abdelhakim Senhaji Hafid to pioneer next-generation security solutions for the Internet of Things. My research integrates blockchain, machine learning, and lightweight cryptography to build privacy-preserving, scalable authentication systems tailored for complex IoT environments.

During my Ph.D. at IIT Patna, I focused on redefining the boundaries of blockchain technology—tackling its scalability, interoperability, and security challenges. My work led to novel architectures enabling secure cross-chain communication, resilient decentralized access control, and privacy-centric ownership transfers.

My broader research passion lies at the intersection of trust, privacy, and decentralization:

- Designing self-sovereign identity frameworks using blockchain, DIDs, and verifiable credentials.

- Fortifying federated IoT systems through behavior-aware AI and adaptive risk-based security.

- Implementing lightweight privacy-enhancing technologies (homomorphic encryption, ZKPs) for resource-constrained devices.

- Engineering scalable consensus protocols and interoperable blockchains for heterogeneous networks.

- Detecting threats in real-time via graph-based temporal modeling for smart ecosystems.

Beyond research, I thrive on mentoring emerging scholars, fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations, and channeling creativity into poetry and sustainable art crafted from upcycled materials.
